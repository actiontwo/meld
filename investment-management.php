Since each client<span>&nbsp;is unique, your overall allocation will be customized to fit your specific needs.</span></p><h2>Situational Investing</h2><p>Investment goals should be measurable and attainable. &nbsp;Success should not depend on outsized investment returns nor upon impractical saving or spending requirements. &nbsp;The experienced specialists at Meld take the time to understand you and your entire financial situation. &nbsp;Then we work with you to create a practical investment plan focused on your specific objectives, implementing a portfolio with the least amount of risk needed to meet your goals. &nbsp;This is "Situational Investing."</p><h3><em><strong>Income and Equity Portfolios</strong></em></h3><p>Using individual equity and fixed income securities we craft portfolios designed to meet your specific income and growth needs. &nbsp;Laddered portfolios of individually selected bonds and preferred equities are created to produce a defined amount of income. &nbsp;Equities are specifically selected for their long-term growth prospects and are monitored on a regular basis for any fundamental changes. From a situational investing standpoint, the use of individual securities provides us the tactical capability to execute an allocation strategy focused on meeting your objectives.</p><h3><em><strong>Mutual Fund Portfolios</strong></em></h3><p><span>Meld Financial maintains several diversified mutual fund portfolios with various allocations across specific market segments. &nbsp;We m</span><span>aintain a rating system for selecting and monitoring the individual mutual funds we use in our portfolios. &nbsp;On a monthly basis, every mutual fund in Meld's portfolios is compared against every other mutual fund in its respective market segment. </span><span>If any of our mutual funds fails to rank well against the other funds in the same category, we place that fund on a watch list and research replacement funds. &nbsp;If the fund continues to under perform, it is replaced.</span></p><p><em><strong>Conservative Portfolio:</strong></em></p><p>The&nbsp;Conservative Portfolio&nbsp;is designed for clients with a short time horizon of generally less than 5 years, or for those investors that are conservative. The portfolio will be invested primarily in bond funds with a small amount of equity fund exposure. The allocation mix is approximately 10%-15% equity funds to 85%-90% bond fund holdings.</p><p><strong><em>Balanced Portfolio:</em></strong></p><p>Clients with an intermediate time horizon of less than 10 years may find the&nbsp;Balanced Portfolio&nbsp;desirable.&nbsp; The portfolio's equity fund exposure balanced with bond fund investments typically works well for a moderate risk investor. The allocation mix is targeted at approximately 50% equity funds and 50% bond funds.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Growth Portfolio:</strong></em></p><p>The&nbsp;Growth Portfolio&nbsp;is designed for higher risk tolerant investors and/or for clients with a longer time horizon, generally in excess of 10 years.&nbsp; Because the portfolio has some bond fund exposure, it is considered to have a moderate growth objective.&nbsp; The allocation mix is approximately 10% bond funds and 90% equity funds.</p><p><em><strong>Aggressive Growth Portfolio:</strong></em></p><p>The&nbsp;Aggressive Growth Portfolio&nbsp;is designed for clients who understand the higher risk attributable to an all equity fund portfolio and/or for those with a longer time horizon period, typically 10 years or more.&nbsp; The portfolio will typically be 100% equity funds.</p><p><em><strong>Aggressive Growth/Emerging Markets:</strong></em></p><p>The&nbsp;Aggressive Growth/Emerging Markets Portfolio&nbsp;is designed for clients who want an equity approach to investing and investments in emerging markets. This portfolio is designed for those with a holding period of 10 years or longer. The bulk of the portfolio will be in domestic equities, with approximately 15% allocation to emerging markets, composed mainly of BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, &amp; China).&nbsp;</p><h2>Â </h2></div></div></div></div></div>
